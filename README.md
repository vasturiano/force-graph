</p>

A web component to represent a graph data structure in a 2-dimensional canvas using a force-directed iterative layout.
Uses HTML5 canvas for rendering and [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) for the underlying physics engine.
Supports canvas zooming/panning, node dragging and node/link hover/click interactions.

| <b>linkDirectionalParticleCanvasObject</b>([<i>fn</i>]) | Callback function for painting custom link particles. Should use the provided canvas context attribute to perform drawing operations for each particle. The callback function will be called for each particle in each link at every frame, and has the signature: `.linkDirectionalParticleCanvasObject(<x>, <y>, <link>, <canvas context>, <current global scale>)`. | |
| <b>emitParticle</b>(<i>link</i>) | An alternative mechanism for generating particles, this method emits a non-cyclical single particle within a specific link.

### Render control

| Method | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :--: |
| <b>autoPauseRedraw</b>([<i>boolean</i>]) | Getter/setter for performance optimization to automatically pause redrawing the canvas at every frame whenever the simulation engine is halted. If you have custom dynamic objects that rely on a constant redraw of the canvas, it's recommended to switch this option off. | `true` |
| <b>pauseAnimation</b>() <br/><sub>(alias: <i>stopAnimation</i>)</sub> | Pauses the rendering cycle of the component, effectively freezing the current view and cancelling all user interaction. This method can be used to save performance in circumstances when a static image is sufficient. | |
| <b>resumeAnimation</b>() | Resumes the rendering cycle of the component, and re-enables the user interaction. This method can be used together with `pauseAnimation` for performance optimization purposes. | |
| <b>centerAt</b>([<i>x</i>], [<i>y</i>], [<i>ms</i>]) | Getter/setter for the coordinates of the center of the viewport. This method can be used to perform panning on the canvas programmatically. Each of the `x, y` coordinates is optional, allowing for motion in just one dimension. An optional 3rd argument defines the duration of the transition (in ms) to animate the canvas motion. A value of 0 (default) centers immediately in the final position. | 0,0 |
| <b>zoom</b>([<i>num</i>], [<i>ms</i>]) | Getter/setter for the canvas zoom amount. The zoom is defined in terms of the scale transform of each px. A value of `1` indicates unity, larger values zoom in and smaller values zoom out. An optional 2nd argument defines the duration of the transition (in ms) to animate the canvas motion. A value of 0 (default) jumps immediately to the final position. | By default the zoom is set to a value inversely proportional to the amount of nodes in the system. |
| <b>zoomToFit</b>([<i>ms</i>], [<i>px</i>], [<i>nodeFilterFn</i>]) | Automatically zooms/pans the canvas so that all of the nodes fit inside it. If no nodes are found no action is taken. It accepts three optional arguments: the first defines the duration of the transition (in ms) to animate the canvas motion (default: 0ms). The second argument is the amount of padding (in px) between the edge of the canvas and the outermost node (default: 10px). The third argument specifies a custom node filter: `node => <boolean>`, which should return a truthy value if the node is to be included. This can be useful for focusing on a portion of the graph. | `(0, 10, node => true)` |
| <b>minZoom</b>([<i>num</i>]) | Getter/setter for the lowest zoom out level permitted. | 0.01 |
| <b>maxZoom</b>([<i>num</i>]) | Getter/setter for the highest zoom in level permitted. | 1000 |
| <b>onRenderFramePre</b>(<i>fn</i>) | Callback function to invoke at every frame, immediately before any node/link is rendered to the canvas. This can be used to draw additional external items on the canvas. The canvas context and the current global scale are included as parameters: `.onRenderFramePre(<canvas context>, <global scale>)`. | - |
| <b>onRenderFramePost</b>(<i>fn</i>) | Callback function to invoke at every frame, immediately after the last node/link is rendered to the canvas. This can be used to draw additional external items on the canvas. The canvas context and the current global scale are included as parameters: `.onRenderFramePost(<canvas context>, <global scale>)`. | - |

Excluded nodes will be left unconstrained and free to move in any direction. | `node => true` |
| <b>onDagError</b>([<i>fn</i>]) | Callback to invoke if a cycle is encountered while processing the data structure for a DAG layout. The loop segment of the graph is included for information, as an array of node ids. By default an exception will be thrown whenever a loop is encountered. You can override this method to handle this case externally and allow the graph to continue the DAG processing.

Follows the same interface as `d3-force`'s [simulation.force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force#simulation_force). Three forces are included by default: `'link'` (based on [forceLink](https://github.com/d3/d3-force#forceLink)), `'charge'` (based on [forceManyBody](https://github.com/d3/d3-force#forceManyBody)) and `'center'` (based on [forceCenter](https://github.com/d3/d3-force#forceCenter)). Each of these forces can be reconfigured, or new forces can be added to the system. | |

| <b>onZoom</b>(<i>fn</i>) | Callback function for zoom/pan events. The current zoom transform is included as single argument `onZoom({ k, x, y })`. Note that `onZoom` is triggered by user interaction as well as programmatic zooming/panning with `zoom()` and `centerAt()`. | - |
| <b>onZoomEnd</b>(<i>fn</i>) | Callback function for on 'end' of zoom/pan events. The current zoom transform is included as single argument `onZoomEnd({ k, x, y })`. Note that `onZoomEnd` is triggered by user interaction as well as programmatic zooming/panning with `zoom()` and `centerAt()`. | - |

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <b>getGraphBbox</b>([<i>nodeFilterFn</i>]) | Returns the current bounding box of the nodes in the graph, formatted as `{ x: [<num>, <num>], y: [<num>, <num>] }`. If no nodes are found, returns `null`. Accepts an optional argument to define a custom node filter: `node => <boolean>`, which should return a truthy value if the node is to be included. This can be useful to calculate the bounding box of a portion of the graph. |
| <b>screen2GraphCoords</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) | Utility method to translate viewport coordinates to the graph domain. Given a pair of `x`,`y` screen coordinates, returns the current equivalent `{x, y}` in the domain of graph node coordinates. |
| <b>graph2ScreenCoords</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) | Utility method to translate node coordinates to the viewport domain. Given a pair of `x`,`y` graph coordinates, returns the current equivalent `{x, y}` in viewport coordinates. |
